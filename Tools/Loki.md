# Loki
Loki is a logging aggregation system that is designed to be easy to use and easy to deploy. Loki is a horizontally scalable, highly available, multi-tenant log aggregation system inspired by Prometheus. It is designed to be very cost effective and easy to operate. It does not index the contents of the logs, but rather a set of labels for each log stream.
