# Nix

## Overview

[Nix](https://nixos.org) is a tool that takes a unique approach in package management and enables a developer to have complete, declarative and reproducible builds. 

Using [Nix](Nix%207784f9d6cc4e4d22b641606d10105fc4.md) allows all developer environments to be highly customized and reproducible making collaboration easier (no need to deal with slightly different environments, just add a `shell.nix` or `flake.nix` to your project) and/or to have greater control over the environment you are running a system in. Nix allows you to define everything in the system from volumes, security, networking, and packages in a single file.
