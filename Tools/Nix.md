# Nix

## Overview

[Nix](https://nixos.org) is a tool that takes a unique approach in package management and enables a developer to have complete, declarative and reproducible builds. 

Using Nix allows all developer environments to be highly customized and reproducible making collaboration easier (no need to deal with slightly different environments, just add a `shell.nix` or `flake.nix` to your project) and/or to have greater control over the environment you are running a system in. Nix allows you to define everything in the system from volumes, security, networking, and packages in a single file.
