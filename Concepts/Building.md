# Building your tools and Cosmos

Since there is no official source for binary builds of Cosmos, validators and users have to build the node and client themselves.

This is _very good_ security-wise, and we hope it stays this way. Trusting another party to provide unaltered binary builds is very dangerous as you cannot easily verify whether the build hasn’t been backdoored. There have been plenty of cases of compromised supply chains in the past [[1]](#puush).

While Git repositories can also be backdoored, it’s a lot harder to do so due to without getting caught, since the repo is an immutable, replicated ledger (almost like - hah - a blockchain!) as long as the repository is regularly pulled by contributors.

_Docker containers_: Docker containers (even with automatic builds) are no exception, in fact, while Docker support signatures, containers aren’t usually signed and Docker does not enforce signature verification by default.

In this chapter, we will explain how to perform simple and reproducible builds of Cosmos’ gaiad and gaiacli as well as to maintain your own patches on top of the upstream sources.

## Performing reproducible builds

Reproducible builds ensure that two parties which build the same binary from the same source will get an identical binary. This makes it a lot easier to trust third party binaries, since they can be independently verified. It also makes it easier to trust your _own_ builds.

Go makes this particularly easy - Go builds are reproducible by default, as long as your build environment (including the compiler version and GOPATH) are identical.

By pinning the exact version of each dependency, we can ensure identical build inputs.

## Maintaining a mirror/fork

In order to be able to easily carry patches and check the authenticity of the Cosmos repository, we always build from our local mirror of the cosmos-sdk repository (which also comes in handy when GitHub is down).

Sometimes it might be necessary for you to apply small patchsets to the Cosmos node, for features like our custom HSM signer ([HSM for Signing](hsm.html)), modifications to the peer discovery code, or emergency bugfixes for exploits that you can’t wait for the upstream team to patch because they’re causing monetary losses _right now_.

Even if you don’t plan to run a Cosmos fork most of the time, you should be prepared to do so on a short notice, if necessary.

A plain mirror can simply be turned into a fork by just committing on top of the master, and doing rebases against origin/master when there’s a new release.

We don’t recommend forking the code base unnecessarily - most of the time, it’s much better to create a PR against the upstream repository. However, you sometimes need to maintain internal modifications - if you do so, try to keep them as small, nonintrosive and self-contained as possible, and in places where the code doesn’t change often to avoid large merge conflicts when rebasing onto upstream master.

This article is a great introduction on how to maintain a fork: [How to maintain a fork](https://rhonabwy.com/2016/04/04/how-to-maintain-a-git-remote-fork/)

For the Cosmos use-case, it might also make sense to mirror/fork Tendermint. You will need to add a `[source]` directive to the `Gopkg.toml` in the cosmos-sdk project to pull your Tendermint fork, and either commit the modified lockfile to your cosmos-sdk repo or do a full dep ensure run at build time (not recommended).
