All of Certus One’s founders fully trust each other, have a long history of working together and neither of us has any intention to walk away. However, we still need to consider the risk of either of us quitting or us falling out with each other, and protect our company and our customers from this risk.

There are many examples of companies meeting an untimely end due to trivial disagreements or founders leaving early while keeping significant stock in the company, making life difficult for the remaining founders when they want to bring in additional investors.

This is why it’s essential to have a carefully designed shareholder contract with clearly defined responsibilities (prevent many disagreements from occuring in the first place).

Business continuity plans are just as important as proper systems engineering, the latter being of little use if the company owning the servers goes under.
